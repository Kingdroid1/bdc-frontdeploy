Furthermore, in an attempt to stall the unfavourable trend of naira instability and inflation, the Central Bank of Nigeria in 2006 brought in operators of bureaux \r\n           de change in the country into the official market, with the objective of encouraging them to buy at official exchange rate and sell to end-users within an approved margin. \r\n           From a humble beginning of about 50 members in 1989 under the pioneering head, then called the Chairman of the committee, Chief Paul Ehiri and other pioneering \r\n           members that included Late Dr.John Anaza, Mr. Moses B. Adeisa, Mr. James O. Tifase and Alhaji Suleiman Farouk, the association has grown from strength to strength with \r\n           a membership numbering above 3000 as at date.With this numerical strength and spread, the association is poised to fulfil its objective of working closely with CBN to \r\n           meet the public’s yearning for a legitimate business in foreign exchange.\r\n         </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section id=\"new\">\r\n        <div class=\"container\">\r\n          <div class=\"row\">\r\n            <div class=\"col-lg-6 col-xs-12\">\r\n              <p class=\"b-left p-16 py-5 px-3\">\r\n                Sequel to this, the Country's apex bank introduced Cash sale of dollars to Bureaux  \r\n                De Change Operators. This new method was encapsulated in the \"FURTHER   \r\n                MEASURES TO LIBERALISE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET IN NIGERIA”,   \r\n                introduced in March 2006 and which came in to effect from April same year.    \r\n                Moreover, with the official empowerment of Bureaux De Change Operators in the   \r\n                country to see to the sale and purchase of foreign exchange, the stage was set for    \r\n                operators in the financial sector to operate more effectively. This has been a major    \r\n                boost to the relevance of ABCON in Nigeria’s financial sector.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"col-lg-6 col-xs-12\">\r\n              <p class=\"text-right\">\r\n                <img src=\"../../public/img/about2.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" />\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"col-lg-12\">\r\n              <p class=\"p-16\">\r\n                From a humble beginning of about 50 members in 1989 under the pioneering head, then called the Chairman of the committee, Chief Paul Ehiri and other pioneering \r\n                members that included Late Dr.John Anaza, Mr. Moses B.
